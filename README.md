## Problem
Less than a third of Canada‚Äôs fish populations, 29.4 per cent, can confidently be considered healthy and 17 per cent are in the critical zone, where conservation actions are crucial.
A fishery audit conducted by Oceana Canada, reported that just 30.4 per cent of fisheries in Canada are considered ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù and nearly 20 per cent of stocks are ‚Äúcritically depleted.‚Äù
Lack of monitoring
"However, short term economics versus long term population monitoring and rebuilding has always been a problem in fisheries decision making. This makes it difficult to manage dealing with major issues, such as species decline, right away." - Marine conservation coordinator, Susanna Fuller

"sharing observations of fish catches via phone apps, or following guidelines to prevent transfer of invasive species by boats, all contribute to helping freshwater fish populations" - The globe and mail
